# Case Study: Phase 1 - Foundational CRM for Individual Clients

This project represents the first phase of a larger strategic operational transformation. It serves as a real-world case study in building a foundational CRM system from scratch for a boutique financial strategy firm. This project is also intended to serve as the capstone for the Google Project Management Professional Certificate.

## 1. The Challenge: Establishing a Single Source of Truth

The firm was operating without a centralized CRM. The workflow was entirely manual, decentralized, and lacked any form of data integrity, leading to significant operational drag and risk. The objective of Phase 1 was to solve this for the most critical value stream: individual client management.

## 2. Project Management & Key Artifacts

This project is being executed following a formal project management lifecycle to ensure rigor and deliver a successful outcome. As the project progresses, the key planning and closing artifacts will be created and linked here.
